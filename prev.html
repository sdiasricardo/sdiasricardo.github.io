                <h3>Coding Skills</h3>
                <p>As a Software Engeneering undergraduate, my coding learnings are as deep as they can
                    be. I have solid knowledge in Python, C, Java, HTML, CSS and Javascript, in addition 
                    to Data Structures and Object Oriented Programming. Right now, I'm aiming to develop 
                    my backend and Java skills, in order to provide a more complete environment and to have
                    to have more tools to work on personal projects.

                <h3>Soft Skills</h3>
                <p>As a team member, I am a very communicative and collaborative person. I love working
                    in a group and having the oportunity to share my knowledge, absorb other experiences 
                    and help my team to accomplish it's goals and strive for greatness. When I'm working
                    by myself, resilience and self-learning are the keys to my projects. I've had the 
                    oportunity not only to put that skills to test, but also to improve them, recognize
                    and work on my flaws in the Young Enterprise project I took part in, wich you can check out

                    speak, write and communicate without any problems. I've also had the oportunity to learn
                    Spanish, leading me to an intermediate level.
